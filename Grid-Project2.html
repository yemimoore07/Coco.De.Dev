            and to make it easier for others to grow alongside. Whether you're a beginner writing your first line 
            of code or a designer trying to break into front-end, this space was crafted with you in mind.</p>
            <br><br>
           <p> Behind the screen is me <b>Bashir Fathia</b>, a passionate front-end developer, UI lover and lifelong 
            learner. I believe in clean code, pixel precision, and sharing knowledge. What started as personal notes 
            quickly became a space for community, conversation and contribution.</p>
